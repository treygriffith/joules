[x] Make Script wrapping stand-alone with defined source and dependencies
[x] Make script wrapping capable on the browser (needs to be tested in more browsers)
[x] Decide how to deal with dependencies (parsing or declaring)
[x] append scripts to the document at run-time
[x] create build process for deployment
[x] parse dependencies
[x] circular dependencies
[ ] cdn support (?) (e.g. jquery on google's cdn)
[ ] tests (re-using node's tests would be ideal)
[ ] core modules support (substack/browserify has a good start on these)
[ ] source mapping
